## Promo page

"Promo page" is one of the test tasks. I liked it because it tested my knowledge in a comprehensive sides. 
There was implemented such things as slider, timer, parallax effect, circle configurable menu. 
Besides I took the first-mobile and BEM approachs

This project gave me experience at the following points: 

- Mobile first layout
- Using js libraries (such as "slick slider", "parallax.js", "jquery")
- Formatting code with "prettier" and "eslint"
- Optimization of images downloading(webP, lazy load, srcset)
- Handling with svg icons style
